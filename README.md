## Purposeful iOS Animations

Examples of animations we found to be meaningful and useful on iOS. We created all with SwiftUI. Grab the Xcode project or use this repo as your source of inspiration for SwiftUI animations for iOS. Have you seen an app animation you love to rebuild and add to this repo?, contact [@amos_gyamfi](https://twitter.com/amos_gyamfi) and [@stefanjblos](https://twitter.com/stefanjblos) on Twitter.

These animations were used for the conference talk, "**Animations Are Cool, Right?**" by Amos & Stefan at [Swift Conf 2022](https://swiftconf.com/#/)
